    If the Observer chose to Report, the Observer and the Bystanders individually decide whether to sanction the Taker.
    The Taker's payoff is reduced by 24 points if at least one of the three players sanctions.
    <p align="justify">
    However, the Taker can loose at most 24 points. If more than one player sanctions, the Taker's payoff is still reduced by 24 points only.
    Each player who selects Sanction pays a cost of 6 points, irrespective of how many other players sanction.
    If none of the three players sanctions, the payoff of the Taker is unaffected.
