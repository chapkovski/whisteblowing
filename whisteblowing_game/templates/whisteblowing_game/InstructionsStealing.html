    At the beginning of each round, one randomly chosen group member (<i><b>Taker</b></i>) decides between two actions:
    <ul align="justify">
    <li><i><b>Take</b></i>: Half of the common pool (18 points) is added to your personal income. The preliminary payoff of the Taker is 8 + 36/2 = 26 points.
    The other half of the common pool is destroyed. The payoff of the other players is 8 points.</li>
    <li><i><b>Leave</b></i>: The common pool is divided equally between the four players. Each player's payoff from this round is 8 + 36/4 = 17 points.</li>
