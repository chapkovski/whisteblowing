    At the beginning of each round, the (<i><b>Taker</b></i>) decides between two actions:
    <ul align="justify">
    <li><i><b>Take</b></i>: Half of the common pool ({{ Constants.stealing_amount }} points) is added to the Taker's earnings.
    The other half of the common pool is destroyed. The Taker receives <nobr>{{ Constants.personal_endowment }} + {{ Constants.stealing_amount }} = {{earnings_thief}} points.</nobr> The other players receive the initial endowment of {{ Constants.personal_endowment }} points.</li>
    <li><i><b>Leave</b></i>: The common pool is equally divided between the four players. All four players receive <nobr> {{ Constants.personal_endowment }} + {{ Constants.common_pool }}/ {{ Constants.players_per_group }} = {{ earnings_from_equal_split }} points.</nobr></li>
</ul>
    <p align="justify">
    In the subsequent stages, the players decide conditional on the Taker's choice to Take, but without knowing the actual decision of the Taker.
    The actual decision of the Taker is revealed to the other players at the end of the round.
    That means the following decisions only apply if the Taker chose to Take. If the Taker chose to Leave, the decisions remain inconsequential.
